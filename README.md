[Brgiht Forest Contract](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xAb359104d87180B0d2506cBc6AC75BCba553dc3c#code)  

## About
Bright forest is based on Dark Forest game dynamic to move game units between two places located by coordinates. In DF this works to move resources between planets, while BF will use it to move "Energy and Chips" between IRL places minted as NFTs on Punk Cities.

Bright Forest uses ZKsnarks to prove that players' IRL location matches with the origin and destination coordinates and validate that the ride is completed. When a ride is completed the player gets energy units from the Bright Forest contract as a reward for the distance traveled on the ride.
